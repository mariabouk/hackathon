The topic of the Hackaton was really interesting as it combined more than one topics, machine learning and signal processing, and it was a well defined real world problem.

First of all we enjoyed the procedure of collecting the data a lot because it was interactive and it gave us the opportunity to do some hands on work with really equipment, and try different things in opposition with tasks that we have already worked in the past.
However, due to the fact that we changed working places, it was difficult to collect them, and the condition were not the same during the 2 days of the hackton.

It was also realy healpful that there were people that we could make questions during the whole hackathon
